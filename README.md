# nativecam_debs
copy of native cam but in deb  format - not my IP


The repository has not been updated for Debian Buster version
As a workaround one can do this:

Download package from https://packagecloud.io/FernV/NativeCAM/packages/debian/stretch/nativecam_0.1.14b_all.deb/download.deb

Install manually: sudo dpkg -i nativecam_0.1.14b_all.deb

Install any missing dependencies: sudo apt --fix-broken install
